The 2024 Indian Premier League  (also known as IPL 17 and branded as TATA IPL 2024) was the 17th edition of the Indian Premier League, a franchise Twenty20 cricket league in India, organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The tournament featured ten teams competing in 74 matches from 22 March to 26 May 2024. It was held across 13 cities in India, with Chennai hosting the opening ceremony and the final. Chennai Super Kings were the defending champions, having won their fifth title during the previous season after beating Gujarat Titans.
In the final, Kolkata Knight Riders defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by 8 wickets to win their third IPL title.


## Format
The format returned to the same as 2022, unlike 2023, with changes in group order. Each team will be playing twice against the teams in their group, against the team in the same row in the other group, and once against the remaining four teams in the other group. After the group stage, the top four teams based on aggregate points qualified for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualified for the final match, the losing team has another chance to qualify for the final match by competing against the winning team of the Eliminator match (in a match titled "Qualifier 2"). The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match will move on to the final match. The team that wins the final match will be crowned the Indian Premier League winners.


## Schedule
On 14 February 2024, the chairman of the Indian Premier League announced that the tournament would take place in India and that the schedule would be finalized after a discussion with the Indian government and other agencies.
